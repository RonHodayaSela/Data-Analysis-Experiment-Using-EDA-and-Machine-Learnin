**Data Analysis Experiment Using EDA and Machine Learning**
*This project was carried out as part of academic studies
Project Overview
This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and apply various machine learning algorithms on a given dataset. The primary objective is to derive insights from the data, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance.

This project involves the analysis of a dataset using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to enhance understanding of the dataset through EDA and to create predictive models that can provide insights and forecasts based on the data.

Data Description
The dataset used in this project consists of various features relevant to the analysis. The data has been split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets for model evaluation.

During the EDA phase, we performed the following:

Data cleaning and preprocessing.
Visualization of data distributions.
Identification of trends and patterns.
Machine Learning Models
We implemented the following machine learning algorithms:

Naive Bayes
Decision Tree
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
K-Means Clustering
Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the performance of the models, we used the following metrics:

Precision
Recall
F-measure
Accuracy
Confusion Matrix
Results
The results of the analysis and the performance of the models are documented in the results.csv.
